# README

My solutions to Advent of Code.  Some are ugly, some are nice.  Some are slow,
some are fast.  Some are written in Haskell, others are not.

## Building

To build a specific solution, use `nix build .#y${YYYY}.d${DD}`, e.g.
`nix build .#y2022.d21`.  To build all solutions, use `nix build`.
